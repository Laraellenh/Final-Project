This project has a React.js front end and Ruby on Rails backend.
I query the Public Library API to grab book titles by Kurt Vonnegut to organize which books I have read so far.
As a big reader, I thought it could be fun to start with an author who I have read a ignificant percentage of the body or works. It could be expanded to search for other authrs and also list their works. It is very basic at this time to allow for unexpected family responsibilities to allow me to graduate on time.

In the future I would love to add more authors, the images for the books covers, and more features for users. 

At this point a user can :
create an account
View 50 works by Kurt vonnegut
select ones to add to their reading list
mark titles as read or not
see the reading list
and logout

in the future, it would be nice to be able to see other user's pages to perhaps do a reading club or help support your child's reading appetite as a parent.
